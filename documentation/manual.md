### Research

Diabetes is a long term condition that causes the level of sugar in blood to be high. Patients suffering from this condition need to always monitor it and depending on the case different medications are suggested. This condition is strongly related to insulin, which is needed to help glucose get from food to the cells. There are two types of diabetes: Type I and Type II. Diabetes Type I happens when the body's immune system fights the cells that produce insulin. Diabetes Type  II which is the most common type of diabetes happens when the body does not produce at all or enough insulin. Even though diabetes is a permanent condition, certain improvements in the diet and activity can help with keeping the diabetes level on track and improving the quality of life. Another important consideration is lowering the chances of developing Diabetes Type II through nutrition and activity. Due to many changes in the lifestyle and increasing numbers of people with obesity, WHO reports that the number of people suffering from diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Many studies have concluded about the importance of following a healthy diet and being active. According to the diabetes journal, 69% of individuals with type 2 diabetes reported no regular physical activity or less than the recommended levels. From the same study, 62% of respondents ate less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, but consumed more than 30% of their daily calories from fat and more than 10% of total calories from saturated fat. As there are many studies, emphasizing the importance of consuming a healthy diet and being more active in either lowering the chances to develop diabetes or preventing diabetes from causing other conditions.
